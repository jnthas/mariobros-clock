If you are using a Jekyll theme by GitHub, you can populate the following file with the desired headers:

_includes/head-custom.html
Because this (AFAIK) overrides the theme-provided file, I recommend using the theme's own file as a starting point. In the cayman theme, for example, it looks like this (link, CC0):

<!-- start custom head snippets, customize with your own _includes/head-custom.html file -->

<!-- Setup Google Analytics -->
{% include head-custom-google-analytics.html %}

<!-- You can set your favicon here -->
<!-- link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="{{ '/favicon.ico' | relative_url }}" -->
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://unpkg.com/esp-web-tools@8.0.3/dist/web/install-button.js?module"></script>
<!-- end custom head snippets -->
